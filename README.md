## A Python based Virtual Assistant - Gideon 

I am a 12th grade student and was trying to get a feel of what it takes to make a small
virtual assistant.

This a desktop app built with tkinter which can reply to simple queries from the user.
You can send a message and it will return a response on what it thinks the message is
by comparing it to preset search parameters. 

I tried to make this work locally without needing any net connection, but
the speech to text recognition of sphinx was inaccurate and so I switched to 
google's speech recognition API which needs a net connection.

### Installation
1. Checkout this code into your computer 
2. You already have python (3.8)(assumption)
3. pip install -r reqirements.txt (this will get the dependency libraries)
4. python Gideon.py
